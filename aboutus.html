                <h2>OUR BEGINNINGS</h2>
                <p>The company was founded in 2000, by Micky Danvers and her family in New York. It all started because
                    the Davers desired to make a family trip to the Caribbean, and couldn’t find an angency that covered
                    every aspect of the journey. Micky decided then to found an agency that could be able to solve
                    everythig a client could possible dream of. That’s when they started to run the company in thei own
                    apartment.
